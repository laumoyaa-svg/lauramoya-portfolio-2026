# INITIAL PHASE OF DESIGNING & CREATING THE PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

I created a mock-up on canvas of how I wanted my website to look.

In the initial stages of the process of modifying the given templates, IA was used within Visual Code (Copilot) to step by step modify elements. 

It didn't prove useful, as it wasn't properly analysing screenshots given with examples of websites. 

Since I have an understanding of the code, I started to modify it myself or using Chatgpt outside the Visual Code, which seemed to be able to analyse better the image given and provide a more accurate model, even though it didn't know the full context of the project.

For example, Copilot was not able to add a footer, proposing changes within the <main> and in between two sections.

At a later stage, it seems Copilot was able to successfully analyse the code and proved useful (for example making templates out of html sections and embedding them into different pages).

It's possible that I wasn't using the right model or the most accurate way to make the prompts. However, ultimately it meant to me wasting more time trying to make it work through AI than directly doing it.

**Summary**
AI is used to create different steps of the process.
