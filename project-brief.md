## Project Concept

### What are you building?
A portfolio website highlighting my most recent work in the two of the three categories that I normally divide my portfolio in: Editorial and Educational.

### Who is it for?
Publishing houses and editorial clients, especially those working with children’s illustration and using the illustration as a method to explore and understand concepts.

Cultural organisations, museums, heritage projects and creative or scientific institutions that need illustration as a tool to cultivate knowledge.

Clients interested in traditional and analogue illustration, such as watercolour and pencil techniques.

### Why does it matter?
The website clearly presents my work so potential clients can quickly understand what type of illustration I create, how it can be applied to their projects and which areas I specialise in. The structure helps visitors navigate different types of work and identify relevant examples efficiently.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style
Visually, the aesthetic should be clean, organic and easy to navigate. The colour palette should be based on pale beige or off-white backgrounds, combined with one strong accent colour to create contrast and visual focus. 

The overall tone should feel calm, welcoming and joyful yet professional and not overly playful or decorative

### Color Palette
<!-- List your main colors -->
#fdf6f1 <!-- Background --> <!-- lighter:faf6f3 darker: #F4F0E8 -->
#131313 <!-- Texts -->
#de4524 <!-- Titles, Accent colour. Alternative: #D2553D -->
#eee3fc <!-- Support colour -->
<!-- #d4eadb alternative to purple: sage. Darker: #C7D6CC -->

### Typography

<!-- What fonts/typeface approach will you use? -->
<!-- Work Sans: Main Titles & also copy text -->
<!-- Caveat: Hand drawn, italic. Captions and secondary Titles -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Caveat:wght@400..700&family=Work+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

## Reflection Questions

### What excites you most about this project?
In the beginning, truth to be told, nothing. Making a portfolio is always a very difficult process for me, as I am not particularly good at making decisive choices. But it is very important to select your best pieces of work instead of showing too much.

Getting back to a black screen with code revived a past trauma, so it wasn't easy to start with the subject.

### What challenges do you anticipate?
Making choices about visual identity is very challenging for me. Deciding on a colour palette, structure, hierarchy of the elements or sections, typography... everything becomes an endless combination of choices.

The same goes for the selection of the pieces to show (illustrations).

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?
It can be useful to learn a method that doesn't require paying for a domain or a premium version of certain applications/platforms.

I work for my own non-profit organisation, where my main mission is to promote collective intelligence about different topics. For that, I use illustration, and this can be a very useful tool to showcase project outcomes in a more interactive and modern way than PDFs (...).

### Conclusions
This project actually made me see my past experience as a very valuable asset. And thanks to this subject, I have managed to look at it in a different way. Although I still consider it very challenging to design a compelling portfolio, both because it requires technical and design-oriented skills: I have learned a way to showcase future proposals and projects, particularly those connected to my work as a visual communicator.

After many attempts at designing a catchy website, I don’t like the final result that much, visually speaking.

I believe the template we were given as a starting point is very useful; however, it is more graphic design-oriented. This is because, as illustrators, we need to highlight our artworks and allow them to stand out above the design of the website. Sections changing colour and gradients can prove useful for more tech or design industry portfolios, but they can make an illustration fade away, as it is already complex in itself (too many elements then you can't see anything anymore). This is the reason why I removed most gradients and some sections.

My own design template kept changing throughout the course of the project, and that made me “waste” time refactoring. I trust this is a normal design process, where you need to do several rounds to see what works and what doesn’t.

### Clean-up of the Project
Due to lack of time and a business trip, I am unable to complete the cleaning of the code in search of elements that are not used (CSS classes, elements, and so on).

I also wanted to perform a renaming of sections.

### Next Steps
Rethinking of the website as a whole, I would like to refactor the structure. 
 
1. Main page - 
    - Hero section, big strong divider with title 'Projects' 
    - Masonry layout to showcase directly there my projects, making the nature of the project (Editorial or Educational) have a different hover colour (or any other style to diffrenciate between them.)
2. About - it would lead to a new page with these components:
    - About Me
    - Skills & Tools 
    - Contact section is placed. 
3. Footer & Header remains

I do not have more time to investon it now, but I have a very good starting point to continue.
