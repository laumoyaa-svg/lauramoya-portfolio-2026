## Project Concept

### What are you building?
<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->
A portfolio website highlighting my most recent work in the two of the three categories that I normally divide my portfolio in: Editorial and Educational.

### Who is it for?
<!-- Define your target audience -->
Publishing houses and editorial clients, especially those working with children’s illustration and using the illustration as a method to explore and understand concepts.

Cultural organisations, museums, heritage projects and creative or scientific institutions that need illustration as a tool to cultivate knowledge.

Clients interested in traditional and analogue illustration, such as watercolour and pencil techniques.

### Why does it matter?

<!-- Explain the purpose and value of your project -->

The website clearly presents my work so potential clients can quickly understand what type of illustration I create, how it can be applied to their projects and which areas I specialise in. The structure helps visitors navigate different types of work and identify relevant examples efficiently.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

<!-- Describe your aesthetic approach -->
Visually, the aesthetic should be clean, organic and easy to navigate. The colour palette should be based on pale beige or off-white backgrounds, combined with one strong accent colour to create contrast and visual focus. 

The overall tone should feel calm, welcoming and joyful yet professional and not overly playful or decorative

### Color Palette

<!-- List your main colors -->
#fdf6f1 <!-- Background --> <!-- lighter:faf6f3 darker: #F4F0E8 -->
#131313 <!-- Texts -->
#de4524 <!-- Titles, Accent colour. Alternative: #D2553D -->
#eee3fc <!-- Support colour -->
<!-- #d4eadb alternative to purple: sage. Darker: #C7D6CC -->

### Typography

<!-- What fonts/typeface approach will you use? -->
<!-- Work Sans: Main Titles & also copy text -->
<!-- Caveat: Hand drawn, italic. Captions and secondary Titles -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Caveat:wght@400..700&family=Work+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
