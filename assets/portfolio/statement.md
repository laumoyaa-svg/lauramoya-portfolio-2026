I see illustration as a way to tell stories and connect with people through images. I am particularly drawn to character-driven work, as I believe characters help audiences relate, engage and feel something beyond the image itself.

My creative process is rooted in observation and analogue techniques. Travel journals, daily scenes, cultural details and small moments strongly influence my work, both in children’s illustration and more editorial or narrative contexts.

Through my illustrations, I aim to create images that invite viewers to pause, explore a story and feel a quiet sense of connection.
